## Payment Authorization

### **Q: What exactly is payment authorization?**

- **No Charges**: No money leaves your account
- **Resolution Options**: Increase limits or negotiate with freelancer

### **Q: Can I authorize payments for multiple freelancers?**
**A:** Yes! You can have unlimited active authorizations:

- **Independent Control**: Manage each authorization separately
- **Different Payment Methods**: Use different cards/accounts per project
- **Centralized Dashboard**: View all authorizations in one place

**A:** Authorizations remain active until:
