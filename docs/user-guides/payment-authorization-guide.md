## What is Payment Authorization?

Payment authorization on SmartFlo allows clients to pre-approve payments for freelance contracts, enabling automatic and secure milestone payments without requiring manual approval for each transaction.

### Key Benefits
- **Faster Payments**: Automatic milestone payments upon completion
- **Secure Escrow**: Your funds are protected in secure escrow accounts
- **Complete Control**: Set limits and revoke authorization anytime
- **Transparent Process**: Full visibility into all transactions
- **Dispute Protection**: 48-hour dispute window for quality assurance

### How It's Different
Unlike traditional payment systems where you pay upfront, SmartFlo's authorization system:
- ✅ Only charges when work is completed and approved
- ✅ Protects your payment method without storing card details
- ✅ Gives you full control over spending limits
- ✅ Provides instant dispute resolution if needed
