# VERCEL PROTECTION BYPASS OPTIONS

## Option 1: Custom Domain Deployment (RECOMMENDED)
Custom domains typically bypass Vercel SSO protection.

### Setup Steps:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Project → Settings → Domains
2. Add custom domain: `getsmartflo.com`
3. Configure DNS records as shown by Vercel
4. Test authentication on custom domain
5. Custom domains often bypass organization SSO policies

### DNS Configuration:
```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com

Type: A  
Name: @
Value: 76.76.19.61
```

## Option 2: Different Vercel Account
Deploy to personal Vercel account without team restrictions.

### Steps:
1. Create new personal Vercel account
2. Import project from GitHub
3. Configure environment variables
4. Deploy without organization policies

## Option 3: Disable Protection in Dashboard

### Check These Locations:
1. **Project Settings → Security**
   - Password Protection: OFF
   - Vercel Authentication: OFF
   - Environment Protection: OFF

2. **Organization Settings → Security**  
   - SSO Enforcement: DISABLED
   - Team Policies: DISABLED

3. **Environment Variables**
   - No protected environments
   - All vars accessible in production

## Option 4: Environment Variable Override
Add protection bypass to vercel.json:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "VERCEL_PROTECTION_BYPASS": "true",
    "DISABLE_SSO": "true"
  }
}
```

## Option 5: Alternative Hosting
If Vercel protection cannot be disabled:

### Netlify Deployment:
```bash
npm run build
# Upload dist/ folder to Netlify
# Configure environment variables
```

### Railway Deployment:
```bash
# Connect GitHub repository
# Configure environment variables  
# Deploy with railway up
```

## Immediate Test Strategy
After any change, verify with:

```bash
# Should return 200 OK, not 401
curl -I https://smartflo-byzg8e7fu-mikesense1s-projects.vercel.app/

# Should return JSON, not SSO page
curl https://smartflo-byzg8e7fu-mikesense1s-projects.vercel.app/api/test
```

## Success Indicators
✅ Homepage loads without SSO redirect
✅ API endpoints return JSON responses  
✅ No _vercel_sso_nonce cookies
✅ Authentication endpoints accessible

The moment protection is disabled, your authentication will work perfectly since the application code is already correct.
