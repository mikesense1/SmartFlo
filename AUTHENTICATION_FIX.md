# Authentication Issues Fixed - Production Deployment

## Root Cause
The authentication issue in production was caused by:
1. CORS headers blocking cookie authentication
2. Secure cookie settings incompatible with development/production
3. Frontend authentication state not properly maintained

## Fixes Applied

### 1. CORS Configuration (api/index.ts)
```javascript
// Fixed CORS to allow specific origin instead of wildcard
res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', process.env.VERCEL_URL ? `https://${process.env.VERCEL_URL}` : 'http://localhost:5173');

// Fixed cookie settings for cross-environment compatibility
res.setHeader('Set-Cookie', `smartflo-auth=${token}; HttpOnly; ${process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 'Secure;' : ''} SameSite=Lax; Max-Age=86400; Path=/`);
```

### 2. Frontend Authentication (client/src/pages/create-contract.tsx)
```javascript
// Added credentials: 'include' to all API calls
credentials: 'include'
```

### 3. Query Client Configuration (client/src/lib/queryClient.ts)
```javascript
// Already configured with proper credential handling
credentials: "include"
```

## Current Status
- ✅ Local authentication working
- ✅ Contract creation working locally  
- ✅ All AI endpoints functional
- ✅ TypeScript compilation fixed
- ✅ Build process successful

## Production Test
After git push, test with:
- demo@smartflo.com / test123 (freelancer)
- client@smartflo.com / test123 (client)

## Verification Steps
1. Login successfully
2. Navigate to /create-contract
3. Complete contract creation wizard
4. Verify no authentication redirects occur
5. Confirm contract is created and saved
