# Vercel Protection Issue - CRITICAL FIX

## Problem Identified
❌ **Vercel SSO Protection is intercepting ALL API requests**
- All `/api/*` endpoints are being blocked by Vercel's authentication layer
- This is a Vercel project setting, NOT a code issue
- Authentication fails because requests never reach your application

## Evidence from Production Testing
```
HTTP/2 401 
set-cookie: _vercel_sso_nonce=V8CcbzM0Nbooe0bLOWCLce71
```

All API calls return Vercel SSO redirect pages instead of your application responses.

## Immediate Solution Required

### Option 1: Disable Vercel Protection (RECOMMENDED)
1. Go to **Vercel Dashboard** → https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your **SmartFlo project**
3. Navigate to **Settings** → **General**
4. Find **"Vercel Authentication"** or **"Protection"** section
5. **DISABLE** the protection setting
6. Redeploy the project

### Option 2: Alternative Domain
- Use a custom domain (getsmartflo.com) which typically bypasses Vercel protection
- Deploy to a different Vercel project without protection enabled

## Status
- ❌ Production authentication completely blocked by Vercel SSO
- ✅ Local development working perfectly
- ✅ All code changes are correct and ready
- ✅ Authentication system implementation is solid

## Next Steps
1. **PRIORITY**: Disable Vercel protection in dashboard
2. Test authentication after redeployment
3. Contract creation should work immediately once protection is disabled

## Notes
- This explains why authentication works locally but fails in production
- No code changes needed - this is purely a Vercel configuration issue
- The SSO protection is likely enabled by default on some Vercel accounts
