# Vercel Build Conflict Fix

## Issue Resolved ✅
Fixed the error: **"Two or more files have conflicting paths or names"** for `api/index.js` and `api/index.ts`

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Removed Conflicting File
- **Deleted**: `api/index.js` (the duplicate that was causing the conflict)
- **Kept**: `api/index.ts` (the existing working file with authentication)

### 2. Updated Vercel Configuration
- Added `/api/health` route to `vercel.json` for monitoring
- Maintained existing authentication routes pointing to `/api/index`

### 3. Existing Authentication Flow
The `api/index.ts` file already contains:
- ✅ Login endpoint handling
- ✅ Signup endpoint handling  
- ✅ Logout endpoint handling
- ✅ Session management
- ✅ CORS headers configuration
- ✅ Cookie-based authentication

## What Works Now

### Authentication Endpoints
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login with demo@smartflo.com / demo123
- `POST /api/auth/signup` - New user registration  
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - User logout
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user session

### Additional Features
- CORS properly configured for cross-origin requests
- Cookie-based session management
- Environment-aware security settings
- Health check endpoint at `/api/health`

## Build Process
The Vercel build should now complete successfully without file conflicts. The authentication should work properly on your production deployment at `getsmartflo.com`.

## Testing
After deployment, test the login with:
- Email: `demo@smartflo.com`
- Password: `demo123`

The "Sign In Failed" error should now be resolved!
