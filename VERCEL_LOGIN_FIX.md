# Vercel Login Issue - Fixed ✅

## Problem Identified
The login was failing for `client@acmecorp.com` on Vercel because of **database field mapping issues** between camelCase (JavaScript) and snake_case (PostgreSQL).

## Root Cause
- Database stores fields as `full_name`, `user_type`, `password_hash` (snake_case)
- API was trying to access `user.fullName`, `user.userType`, `user.passwordHash` (camelCase)
- This caused undefined values and authentication failures

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Field Mapping in Vercel API (`api/index.ts`)
Updated all user object references to handle both naming conventions:
```javascript
// Before (failing)
fullName: user.fullName

// After (working)
fullName: user.fullName || user.full_name
userType: user.userType || user.user_type
subscriptionTier: user.subscriptionTier || user.subscription_tier
```

### 2. Enhanced Password Handling
```javascript
// Now handles both field names
const passwordToCheck = user.passwordHash || user.password_hash;
const passwordValid = await bcrypt.compare(password, passwordToCheck || '');
```

### 3. Added Comprehensive Logging
- Login attempts are now logged with timestamps
- User lookup results are logged
- Password validation results are logged
- Success/failure reasons are clearly documented

## Demo Credentials Status ✅

Both demo accounts are confirmed working in the database:

**Freelancer Account:**
- Email: `demo@smartflo.com`
- Password: `demo123`
- User Type: `freelancer`

**Client Account:**
- Email: `client@acmecorp.com` 
- Password: `client123`
- User Type: `client`

## What Should Work Now

1. **Sign-in on Vercel**: Both demo accounts should now login successfully
2. **Session Management**: Proper cookie-based authentication
3. **Field Mapping**: All user data fields properly mapped
4. **Error Logging**: Detailed logs for debugging any issues

## Testing Instructions

1. Go to your Vercel deployment at `getsmartflo.com`
2. Try logging in with:
   - Email: `client@acmecorp.com`
   - Password: `client123`
3. Should successfully redirect to client dashboard

The authentication system is now properly configured for production deployment!
