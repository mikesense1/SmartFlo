# Vercel Authentication Fix Guide

## Issues Fixed

1. **Session Configuration**: Updated session middleware to handle HTTPS and cross-origin requirements for Vercel
2. **Database Connection**: Enhanced connection handling with proper timeouts and error logging
3. **CORS Headers**: Added proper CORS configuration for Vercel deployment
4. **API Routing**: Created Vercel-compatible API handler

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Updated Session Configuration (`server/index.ts`)
- Set `secure: true` for production (HTTPS required)
- Set `sameSite: 'none'` for cross-origin requests in Vercel
- Added environment-aware configuration

### 2. Enhanced Database Connection (`server/db.ts`)
- Added connection timeout for Vercel's serverless environment
- Enhanced error logging and connection testing
- Better environment variable validation

### 3. Improved Authentication (`server/auth.ts`)
- Added detailed logging for debugging login issues
- Enhanced session save handling for Vercel
- Better error handling and user feedback

### 4. Created Vercel API Handler (`api/index.js`)
- Dedicated entry point for Vercel deployment
- Proper CORS and session configuration
- Health check endpoints for monitoring

## Environment Variables Required on Vercel

Make sure these are set in your Vercel dashboard:

```
DATABASE_URL=your_neon_database_url
SESSION_SECRET=your_secure_session_secret
NODE_ENV=production
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
```

## Testing the Fix

1. Deploy to Vercel
2. Test health endpoint: `https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/health`
3. Test authentication with demo credentials:
   - Email: demo@smartflo.com
   - Password: demo123

## Common Vercel Auth Issues Resolved

- ✅ Session not persisting across requests
- ✅ CORS errors preventing login
- ✅ Database connection timeouts
- ✅ Cookie security issues with HTTPS
- ✅ Cross-origin session handling

The sign-in should now work properly on your Vercel deployment!
